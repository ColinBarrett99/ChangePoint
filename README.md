# ChangePoint

This is an R Shiny dashboard that allows users to explore when top NBA point guards experience change in KPIs throughout their careers. By understanding the changes experienced by both a sample of players and individual players, users can make more accurate assessments of the trajectory of current players.

This project was developed to support the learning of sport analytics students at Ohio University, where I designed an exercise around change point analysis.

Change point analysis is a useful technique for identifying when a significant change occurs in a set of time series data, and generally filters out noise in the data to uncover actual trends. However, due to the brevity of some NBA players careers in the data set, error due to small sample size is a concern.
